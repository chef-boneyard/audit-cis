# WORK IN PROGRESS

As of this initial release, this cookbook is still a work in progress. Not all recommendations from the CIS benchmarks are implemented.

# audit-cis

This cookbook implements recipes that perform a Chef Audit Mode check for the CIS Benchmarks. Each recipe represents an entire benchmark's implementation. They are intended to be run wholesale against the target platform. The check may fail depending on the base OS installation.

This cookbook is intended to be used only with Chef's audit mode and should not make any changes to the system. Implementation of the benchmarks is up to individuals and organizations security policy. This cookbook does not perform any sort of "scoring" according to the CIS Benchmarks.

This cookbook is not supported or endorsed by the Center for Internet Security or its affiliates. We may opt

- [CIS Benchmarks](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/)
- [Chef Audit Mode](http://docs.chef.io/analytics/chef_client.html)

# Requirements

Chef 12.1.0 or higher.

## Platform

- CentOS 7
- CentOS 6

# Recipe Naming

Recipes are named according to the benchmark that they check. For example, the [CIS CentOS Linux 7 Benchmark v1.0.0](http://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/show-single/?file=centos7.100) recipe is named `centos7-100`. If a v1.0.1 is released, a new recipe would be added, `centos7-101`.

The CIS publishes separate benchmarks across platform families. These are implemented as separate recipes in this cookbook. For example, there are benchmarks for CentOS 7 and RHEL 7. While these distributions are binary compatible, they are implemented in separate benchmarks, and separate recipes in this cookbook.

Recipes will be updated to the latest benchmark as is deemed reasonable and for newer point releases of individual distributions. For example, the CentOS 7 benchmark may be equally applicable on CentOS 7.1.

# Usage

Add the recipe for the desired benchmark to the appropriate nodes. Failures mean that the node does not comply with the benchmark's validation rules. Depending on site-specific security policies and business requirements, failures can be safe to ignore. In this case it may be desirable to implement Chef Analytics rules to filter and notify only on failures that are in scope.

# Roadmap

Other platform benchmarks will be added in the future. We will target the following next:

- Ubuntu 14.04
- Ubuntu 12.04
- Windows Server 2012

It is not yet determined whether other non-platform benchmarks will be implemented (e.g., Apache HTTPD) in this cookbook, or in another one.
